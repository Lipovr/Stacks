Stacks
Default main function creates array of four pointers to "Stack" class, fills it with 2 subforwardlists and two vectors (odd are vectors, even are subforwardlists).
Then it fills every stack with five numbers from 0 to 5, prints their new contents and finally pops back from each stack while printing results.
